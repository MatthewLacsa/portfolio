To get (pull) an image from Docker Hub or another registry, use:

```
docker pull [image_name]:[tag]
```

For example:
```
docker pull ubuntu:latest
```

If you want to list images you already have locally:
```
docker images
```

_**Assistant**_

To use an environment file with Docker and run a container, you'll need to:

1. First, pull the image:
```
docker pull [image_name]:[tag]
```

2. Then run the container with the environment file:
```
docker run --env-file [path_to_env_file] [image_name]:[tag]
```

For example, if you have a `.env` file and want to use the `nginx` image:
```
docker run --env-file .env nginx:latest
```

You can add other options like port mapping (`-p`), volume mounts (`-v`), or running in detached mode (`-d`).
