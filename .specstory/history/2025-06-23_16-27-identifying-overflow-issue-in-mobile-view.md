I'll examine what's causing the horizontal overflow on mobile. Looking at your code, I see a few potential causes:

I've found the issue. The horizontal overflow in mobile view is likely caused by:

1. The SVG waves at the bottom of your page have a width of `w-[200%]`. While you do have `overflow-hidden` on their parent container, the layout might not be containing them properly.

2. There's no proper viewport meta tag in your layout file that would ensure proper scaling on mobile devices.

Here's how to fix it:

---

```diff
    title: "Create Next App",
    description: "Generated by create next app",
+   viewport: "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1",
  };
  
```

---

```diff
    return (
      
-     <div className="relative h-screen flex flex-col items-center justify-center bg-neutral-900">
+     <div className="relative h-screen flex flex-col items-center justify-center bg-neutral-900 overflow-x-hidden">
        {/* Pressable links projects and about me*/}
        <motion.h1
```

```diff
        }}
      >
-      <div className="flex gap-6 text-2xl">
+      <div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-6 text-2xl">
  
                  <Link
```

```diff
      {/* My animated name, planning to make this interactive hmm */}
      <motion.h1
-       className="text-5xl sm:text-7xl md:text-8xl lg:text-8xl font-bold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-[#ecfcff] to-[#6d6d9c] text-center"
+       className="text-5xl sm:text-7xl md:text-8xl lg:text-8xl font-bold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-[#ecfcff] to-[#6d6d9c] text-center px-4"
        initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.5 }}
        animate={{ opacity: 0.40, scale: 1 }}
```

```diff
  
  
-         <div className="absolute bottom-0 left-0 w-full overflow-hidden text-[0]">
+         <div className="absolute bottom-0 left-0 right-0 overflow-hidden text-[0]">
            {/* This is the wave at the very back*/}
            <svg
```

I've fixed the horizontal overflow issue with these changes:

1. Added proper viewport meta tag in the layout file to ensure correct mobile scaling.

2. Added `overflow-x-hidden` to the main container to prevent any horizontal scrolling.

3. Made the links container use `flex-wrap` and `justify-center` so they'll stack properly on smaller screens instead of forcing horizontal overflow.

4. Added padding (`px-4`) to the name text to prevent it from touching the edges on mobile.

5. Changed the waves container from using `w-full` to using `left-0 right-0` positioning which is more reliable for full-width elements.

These changes should resolve the horizontal overflow while maintaining your design.
